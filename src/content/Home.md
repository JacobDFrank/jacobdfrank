intro: My nameâ€™s Jacob and this is my website
about1: >-
  I'm a San Francisco based designer, technologist, and civic tech strategist
  who takes bike rides down hills and walks up big ones.

  <br><br>

  Currently, I'm an experience designer working on <a
  href="http://spectrum.adobe.com/">Adobe's design system, Spectrum</a> where I
  design the Spectrum for Adobe XD plugin, and help grow the Spectrum Design
  Language.


  On the side, I work on <a href="http://sfserviceguide.org">SF Service
  Guide</a>, leading a team of designers and managing the project with other
  wonderful people.

  Prior to Adobe I studied at <a href="https://www.rit.edu/">RIT</a> and
  graduated from <a href="https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/sois/">the School
  of Individualized Studies</a> where I spent most of my time managing and
  working on a <a href="https://www.jacobdfrank.com/projects/tawOrgSite">yearly
  design conference</a> with some inspiring faculty and students. I keep a list
  of design resources for anyone interested in getting into the field

  I spend the rest of my time cooking, getting lost on Wikipedia, reading comics
  and taking poorly lit photographs.
