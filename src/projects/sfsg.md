## Helped lead the design for multiple features and redesigns of SF Service Guide.

These designs are on track for development. 
All the projects have used and helped contribute to the design system as they've been designed and implemented.

Lately I've been helping and mentoring junior designers on my team on features. It has been a very insightful and enriching process.
